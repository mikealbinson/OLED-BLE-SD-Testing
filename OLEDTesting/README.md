#OLEDTesting

the files here describe the methods and wrapper class for the OLED system
TicketTesting.ino is the example doc where I demonstrate both the OLED libraries and the Testing Library .
The only current issue is that the OLEDResponses drawGeneral function will not return the proper c-string, so all the 
tests fail.

--it's all a work in progress
