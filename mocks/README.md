A slightly more succinct version of the three mock object libraries combined

Includes Mocktesting.ino, which demonstrates the output of the tests included in the files

#NOTE: to use you will need to download and include:

#include <U8gLibClone.h>
#include <Testing.h>
#include <SPI.h> //included in the default arduino libs, no need to download
#include <boards.h>
#include <RBL_LibCLONE.h>
