#Mocks

A slightly more succinct version of the three mock object libraries combined

Includes Mocktesting.ino, which demonstrates the output of the tests included in the files

I haven't implemented all of the functions in the example so I'll be working on that for now

Also hoping include a "send" method for the BLE that will report an iBeacon signal being sent even though we can't do that with the current hardware

#NOTE: to use you will need to download and include:

 U8gLibClone.h
 
 Testing.h
 
 SPI.h //included in the default arduino libs, no need to download
 
 boards.h
 
 RBL_LibCLONE.h

to use the example
